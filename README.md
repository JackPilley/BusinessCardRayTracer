# BusinessCardRayTracer
A very simple raytracer that can fit on the back of a business card (with a bit of font tweaking).
The output is a ppm file which can be opened with GIMP or another image editing software. Any C++ compiler should be able to compile the program on any platform with a filesystem.

Features:
* ADS Lighting
* Reflections
* Depth blur
* Shadows

Created as an exercise during the 2022 Winter holidays.
